# Marketing Guidelines

Ecosystem teams and developers that have published on the dApp Store can receive co-marketing support from Solana Mobile. Usually,
this support comes in the form of engagement with marketing content.

The co-marketing for a dApp launch typically follows:

- Developers publish a dApp and connect with Solana Mobile for App Review.
- Prepare the copy/content and share with Solana Mobile for inspection.
- If compliant, then we can coordinate the engagement on social media.
  - Additionally, developers can request a specific time for the app to go live.

Ensure you read through the restrictions and guidelines below, before you prepare your content.
