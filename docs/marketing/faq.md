    that are engaging with the Solana Mobile community (e.g Publishing an app on the dApp Store).

    For more information, view the [Co-marketing Guidelines](/marketing/comarketing-guidelines) documentation.

  <FAQSection title="How can I target Seeker users?">
    Users that preordered Chapter 2 received a *Chapter 2 Preorder Token NFT*. This NFT is a way for ecosystem teams to target those who preordered the Seeker through rewards programs, incentives, and other benefits.

    For more information, view the [Targeting Seeker Users](/marketing/engaging-seeker-users) documentation.

  <FAQSection title="What's a good amount of people to target for an airdrop?">
    
    Ultimately, it's up to each team to determine how they want to distribute rewards based on their own factors like their treasury supply, the scale of the rewards, and which segments of the Solana Mobile community they aim to target.

    Some teams choose to distribute rewards across the entire Solana Mobile community, while others take a more segmented approach.

    Some examples of strategies we've seen teams look to target:

    - Airdrops to the most active wallets holding a Chapter 2 Preorder Token
    - Airdrops to a fixed number of wallets (e.g., 10k or 50k)
    - Claim sites that are open for a limited time (e.g., a set number of days or hours)
    - Wallets that hold both a Chapter 2 Preorder Token and a Genesis Token

    The discoverability of an app is based on a variety of factors, including ratings & reviews. We are working on more features to improve discoverability of apps on the dApp Store. More info to come!
