#### Restricted Content on Twitter/X

- Partnership References:
  - Any use of the word "partnership" or any variations thereof.
- Monetary Symbols in Twitter Handles:
  - Profiles featuring a "$" sign before their name (e.g., "$SOL").
- Ticker Symbols:
  - Explicit mentions of ticker symbols like "$SOL" or "$BONK".
- Promotional Statements:
  - Optimistic phrases such as "Solana to the moon!" or "BONK to the TOP".
- SEC Mentions:
  - Any reference to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

### 2. Prepare and share your content copy

After you have drafted and prepared your content, we strongly encourage every team to share their announcement copy/draft with us before posting on X or other socials. This will allow our team to review and ensure timely engagement from the Solana Mobile X account.

### 3. Coordinate engagement

After content approval, you can specify time to commence the announcement and engagement from the Solana Mobile X account.

If you are launching a dApp or releasing a new update, you can request a specific time for your app to go live, to align with marketing efforts.
