# Co-marketing Guidelines

Solana Mobile may provide co-marketing support to dApp publishers or ecosystem teams that are looking to engage with the Solana Mobile community. Typically, this support is provided through engagement on social media.

## Types of Marketing Content

These are examples of the different types of content we have engaged with from the Solana Mobile X account:

- dApp Store announcements and listing teases.
- Community activations for Saga/Seeker holders (e.g. game nights, Solana Mobile community specific events).
- Exclusive programs for Saga/Seeker holders like rewards, discounts and incentives.

If you are interested in reaching the Solana Mobile community with similar content, here are some best practices for the co-marketing process.

## Best Practices for Co-marketing

These are the best practices to plan out a co-marketing campaign for the Solana Mobile community.

### 1. Understand Solana Mobile's Goals

Solana Mobile's goal is to engage with content from ecosystem partners that is focused on decentralized Apps and exclusive programs and activations for the Solana Mobile community. Extraneous marketing, such as a focus on non-product related economics, is not aligned with Solana Mobile's goals. For best practices, it is encouraged to have ecosystem partners/collaborators share their copy for review before posting.

### 2. Prepare and share your content copy

It is encouraged that ecosystem partners/collaborators share copy for review before posting.
After you have drafted and prepared your content, we strongly encourage every team to share their announcement copy/draft with us before posting on X or other socials. This will allow our team to review and ensure timely engagement from the Solana Mobile X account.

### 3. Coordinate engagement

After content approval, you can request times to commence the announcement and engagement from the Solana Mobile X account. 

If you are launching a dApp or releasing a new update, you can request a specific time for your app to go live, to align with marketing efforts.
