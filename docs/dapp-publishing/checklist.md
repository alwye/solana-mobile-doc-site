# dApp Store Pre-submission Checklist

Before you begin the publishing process, make sure that your app meets all of the requirements and guidelines listed on this checklist.

### App Functionality & Testing

- Test your app for crashes and bugs. You do not need a Seeker or Saga to test your app, just test against a comparable Android device or emulator.
- If using Mobile Wallet Adapter, ensure users are able to connect and sign successfully using any given MWA-compatible wallet (e.g Phantom, Solflare)
- If your app content is gated (e.g beta access, NFT-gated), prepare a test account with full access for App Review.

### Technical Requirements

- Release APK file prepared and signed. PWAs can follow [this guide](/dapp-publishing/publishing-a-pwa) to convert to an APK.
- App Permissions properly declared in manifest.
- A developer Solana wallet for use with our Publishing CLI.

### Content and Assets

- Prepare a minimum of 4 image or video files to be included in your dApp Store listing page.
- See the dApp Listing Guidelines for best practices and a visualization of your dApp's listing page.

### Legal and Compliance

- Read the Developer Agreement and Policy to ensure your app meets requirements.

### Get in contact

- Join Solana Mobile Developer Discord, grab the _developer_ role, and leave a message in the `#dapp-store` channel.
