To publish an app, the summarized process is:

1. Installing our Publishing CLI and prepare your publishing assets (e.g icon, screenshots, video previews)
2. Mint a set of NFTs describing your App and Publisher details
3. Submit a signed release APK of your app

For a full explanation, diagrams, and a step by step guide of the complete publishing flow, view the Publishing Overview page.

### Can I publish a PWA onto the dApp Store?

Yes! With a few additional steps, you can convert a PWA into an Android app and generate an APK for app submission.

For a tutorial and more information, view our PWA documentation.

### Can I get a developer kit for testing?

We are not running a developer device program for the Seeker. It is sufficient to test your app against standard Android devices or emulators, and we also provide an example wallet app that developers can test their app against.

For best practices about testing your app, view our testing documentation.
