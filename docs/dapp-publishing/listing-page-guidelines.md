# dApp Listing Guidelines

import ListingPageSection from '@site/src/components/ListingPageSection';

Your dApp's listing page is often the first impression users will have of your application.
These guidelines will help you create a compelling and informative listing that showcases your dApp.

<ListingPageSection
title="App Icon"
imageSrc="/img/dappstorelisting.png">

Your app icon is one of the first elements of your app that users see, so it's essential to make a strong first impression that communicates your app's quality and purpose. Work with a graphic designer to create an icon that is simple and recognizable. Try testing different options to determine which icon is the most recognizable and meaningful to your target audience.

To ensure the icon is legible in all sizes, avoid adding unnecessary visual details. For information about creating a beautiful and memorable icon, see the Human Interface Guidelines.

<ListingPageSection
title="App Name"
imageSrc="/img/dappstorelisting.png">

Your app's name plays a critical role in how users discover it on the App Store. Choose a simple, memorable name that is easy to spell and hints at what your app does. Be distinctive. Avoid names that use generic terms or are too similar to existing app names. An app name can be up to 30 characters long.

<ListingPageSection
title="Subtitle"
imageSrc="/img/dappstorelisting.png">

Your app's subtitle is intended to summarize your app in a concise phrase. Consider using this, rather than your app's name, to explain the value of your app in greater detail. Avoid generic descriptions such as "world's best app." Instead, highlight features or typical uses of your app that resonate with your audience. You can update your subtitle when submitting a new version of your app to help you determine the subtitle that's most effective for engaging users. A subtitle can be up to 30 characters long and appears below your app's name throughout the App Store.

<ListingPageSection
title="Preview"
imageSrc="/img/dappstorelisting.png">

### Videos

An app preview demonstrates the features, functionality, and UI of your app in a short video that users watch directly on the App Store. Previews can be up to 30 seconds long and use footage captured on the device to show the experience of using your app. You can feature up to three app previews on your App Store and Mac App Store product pages, and localize them for all available App Store languages.

### Screenshots

Use images captured from your app's UI to visually communicate your app's user experience. You can feature up to 10 screenshots on your App Store and Mac App Store product pages. Depending on the orientation of your screenshots, the first one to three images will appear in search results when no app preview is available, so make sure these highlight the essence of your app. Focus each subsequent screenshot on a main benefit or feature so that you fully convey your app's value. If your app supports Dark Mode, consider including at least one screenshot that showcases what the experience looks like for users.

For screenshot specifications, see App Store Connect Help.

<ListingPageSection
title="Description"
imageSrc="/img/dappstorelisting.png"
isLast={true}>

Provide an engaging description that highlights the features and functionality of your app. The ideal description is a concise, informative paragraph followed by a short list of main features. Let potential users know what makes your app unique and why they'll love it. Communicate in the tone of your brand, and use terminology your target audience will appreciate and understand. The first sentence of your description is the most important â€” this is what users can read without having to tap to read more. Every word counts, so focus on your app's unique features.
